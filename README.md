# Tom's Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

We were motivated to develop a program which would store our notes from our pre-work study. It allowed us an easy location to store our notes, as well as providing a function to randomly give us topics to review. We learnt how to code HTML, Git push/pul and branch work, JavaScript and CSS
